There are eight possible variables:

Final Velocity - FV (what we want to calculate)
Initial Velocity - IV (0 since the car begins at rest every time)
Gravity -g (9.81 every time)
mu (ranges from 0.2 to 0.8)
Distance - d (ranges from 20 m to 100 m)!pau
Theta (the angles, ranges from 30 degrees to 45 degrees)
Time - t (calculated from info given)
Acceleration - a (calculated from info given)

a = g * (sin(theta) - mu * cos(theta))
time = sqrt((2 * d) / a)

We want to find for the final velocity, and there are two ways we can do that:

1. FV = IV + at
2. FV = sqrt(IV^2 + 2 * a * d)

If the car releases its brakes from rest on the slope, what will be the final velocity of the car?
